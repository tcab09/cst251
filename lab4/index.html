<h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
<h3>The Subject of This Lab</h3>
<p> For this lab we had to work together with a partner and
test our files and in order to then successfully upload them to the server.</p>
<h3>Summary of Efforts and difficulties</h3>
<p> I am new to html so this whole lab was a learning process. I came across
	many difficulties first I could not upload my images. Then my links would not
	work.through trial and error and with help I managed to complete this lab.
	Once I got passed all those issues I got started on my code for lab 4. I
	inserted my images into the corresponding sections. double checked that
	everything worked, everything being my labs 2 - lab 4. once I knew that
 	everything worked properly I began to focus on successfully uploading my website. </p>
